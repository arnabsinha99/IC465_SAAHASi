1,Apple Scab,Apple,Fungal,"Dark, irregularly-shaped lesions develop on the foliage, blossoms and developing fruits
The fungal disease forms pale yellow or olive-green spots on the upper surface of leaves and fruits. 
Dark, velvety spots may appear on the lower surface of the leaf.

","Rarely kills its host.
Scabby spots are sunken and tan and may have velvety spores in the center. 
As these spots mature, they become larger and turn brown and corky. 
Infected fruits and leaves become distorted and may crack allowing entry of secondary organisms. 
Severely affected fruits and leaves may drop, especially when young.",,Places that have Apple Cultivations,"Rarely kills a plant. If severity level is high in some case, it makes the plant prone to other infections.","With or without chemicals, there is no viable cure for an infected tree during the season once damage is present.
Spray the apple tree foliage with a fertilizer mixture containing 5% urea.
Can also churn the fallen leaves so that the fungus cannot grow in the suitable weather.","Benzimidazole fungicides

Bonide Orchard Spray","Choose resistant varieties when possible.
Rake under trees and destroy infected leaves to reduce the number of fungal spores available to start the disease cycle over again next spring.
Water in the evening or early morning hours (avoid overhead irrigation) to give the leaves time to dry out before infection can occur.
Spread a 3- to 6-inch layer of compost under trees, keeping it away from the trunk, to cover soil and prevent splash dispersal of the fungal spores.
For best control, spray liquid copper soap early, two weeks before symptoms normally appear. Alternatively, begin applications when disease first appears, and repeat at 7 to 10 day intervals up to blossom drop.",Wikipedia
2,Black rot,Apple,"Fungal
Infects fruits, leaves and bark.",Often limited to leaf symptoms such as purple spots on upper leaf surfaces,"As these spots age, the margins remain purple, but the centers dry out and turn yellow to brown. 
Over time, the spots expand and heavily infected leaves drop from the tree. 
Infected branches or limbs will show characteristic red-brown sunken areas that expand each year.",,,"Fruit infection is the most destructive form of this pathogen and begins with infected flowers, before fruits expand.
When fruits are tiny and green, you’ll notice red flecks or purplish pimples that enlarge as the fruit does. 
Mature fruit lesions take on a bulls-eye appearance, with bands of brown and black areas expanding outward from a central point in each lesion. 
Commonly, black rot disease causes blossom end rot or mummification of the fruits on the tree.","Treating black rot on apple trees starts with sanitation because fungal spores overwinter on fallen leaves, mummified fruits, dead bark and cankers, it’s important to keep all the fallen debris and dead fruit cleaned up and away from the tree.
During the winter, check for red cankers and remove them by cutting them out or pruning away the affected limbs at least six inches beyond the wound. 
Destroy all infected tissue immediately and keep a watchful eye out for new signs of infection.","general purpose fungicides, like copper-based sprays and lime sulfur, can be used to control black rot, nothing will improve apple black rot like removing all sources of spores.",make sure to remove any injured or insect-invaded fruits to avoid re-infection,
