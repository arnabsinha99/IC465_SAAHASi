- Heroku CLI

## Dataset Used
We have used a part of the PlantVillage Dataset for training our Deep Learning Model. Click [here](https://github.com/arnabsinha99/IC465_SAAHASi/tree/master/models) to find the codes for the model.

You can find the dataset used [here](). For the complete PlantVillage Dataset, refer to [this link](https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset).

In addition to this, we reconciled details for different diseases and which will be used to provide remedies and other important information related to the plant after the disease is detected in the image. You can view the same by following [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W_laHMglYh4LnsfSw7Qha3ebn8Iubw6yiAYCM3mDYlM/edit?usp=sharing).

## Server
The model and forum are deployed on the Heroku server and are easily accessible using the following links:
